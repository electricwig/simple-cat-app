# simple-cat-app
A simple one-page cat app!

A single page app that displays a random cat fact, which is retrieved from 'https://catfact.ninja/fact', a free API, via the fetch method. 

Made to test out some of the HTML, CSS and javascript I have learnt during the Odin Project's "Foundations" section - in particular flexbox and an excuse to try out some basic javascript. 

Took longer than expected to get the API call working. It was easy to display the data in the console log, but there were a few extra steps (i.e. some googling) to be able to 'stringify' that data - in the end it seemed that an 'asynchronous' function was needed, something I'm hoping to fully wrap my head around as I progress through the foundations.
