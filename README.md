# simple-cat-app
A simple one-page cat app!

A single app that displays a random cat fact, retrieved from 'https://catfact.ninja/fact', a free API, via the fetch method. 

Made to test out some of the HTML, CSS and javascript I've learnt during the Odin Project's "Foundations" section - in particular flexbox and an excuse to try out some basic javascript. 

It took longer than expected to get the API call working. It was relatively easy to display the data in the console log, but there were a few extra steps (and some googling needed) to be able to 'stringify' the data - in the end it seemed that an 'asynchronous' function was required, something I'm hoping to fully wrap my head around as I progress through the foundations.
